        <p class="lead mb-4">My name is KaiIen Martinez Escareno was born in Upland, California on March 30, 2001. However, I was raised in Fontana California. I went to preschool in Live Oak elementary school. And continued my education there for kindergarten and first grade. Then I attended Beech elementary school for second, third, fourth, fifth, and sixth grade. When I was done with sixth grade, I attended Sequoia Middle School for seventh grade and eighth grade. Here I learned the best leading and organizing skills because I was in the Associated Student Body program for both of my years there. 
Once I was done with primary school, I started secondary school at Henry J. Kaiser High School. My freshman year I did not know what I was going to study at college even less what college I would attend. Then my second year I began thinking about what college I would want to attend and what field I am best at and would love. My junior year I realized math was extremely intriguing because I loved being able to try the problem in so many ways and still get the same answer because math was straight to the point whereas English was dreadful because you never knew whether or not your answer was correct because there were infinite possibilities. In my junior year I also started working in retail which was helped me learn a lot about time management and taught me to save most of my money. Finally, in my senior year I focused on the reality of my future. I realized the best option for me was University of Riverside in California. For one this was the closest school because I could drive home and to school with only a thirty minute, sometimes only twenty five, drive so I could be able to help my family whatever their needs. Second, this school was closer in my range to pay tuition and fees every year without putting my family or I in debt. Finally, this school had both of the majors I was leaning towards so it was the perfect school for me.
College was going to start in a few months so I got another job and saved more money up in order to buy a car and use it for school. In only a few months I earned my car and got my drivers license. Once I began my college education, I based my major on math. However, I encountered many obstacles because the math I had to take in order to focus on calculus was pre-calculus and it was extremely confusing since my mindset had been molded to calculus. I failed on my first attempt at the class but the next time I was successful and passed the class with a B. However, as my first year at college went by, I realized a major in math would not give me many options. So, I began searching for majors that integrated math and I stumbled on business administration. I have always wanted to run my own business so I decided it would be the best initiative step towards my goal.
